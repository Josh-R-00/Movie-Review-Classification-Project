These days are slim Pickens for anyone who wants to actually go into a movie theater and watch a film the way it should be seen. Covid has made theaters play old blockbusters, which I think is great but the 1st run films have been at best below average. When I saw the trailer for Half Brothers I knew exactly the type of movie it would be. A road trip story about 2 brothers who can't stand each other come to love each other on a trip to find out what happened to their father. These type of stories have been done before and much better.

The performances are lively but there isn't any real tension and the comedy at best insipres grins and moans ar worst. The film also tries to bang the illegal immigration subject home with showing Americans as ignorant bigots. It's so in your face it's insulting.

A sitcom without the laugh track!!!

A waste!!!

Grade: D
