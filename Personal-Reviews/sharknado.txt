When I saw this glorious film on the esteemed syfy network, I knew they had another massive, award winning hit that would get snubbed out of any award ceremonies. Now, time to be serious. I assumed Tara Reid was dead. Didn't even know she was alive so I was shocked to see her in this movie. Sharknado was like a cluster f word of things that didn't make sense. It was so bad that I couldn't stop watching this train wreck of a movie. Bad cgi doesn't cut it. While it may not have been birdemic bad, but it wasn't much better. Watching the movie all the way through is what I am assuming a brain aneurism feels like. I am sad that I watched it.
