    "# Text Classification for Movie Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "With this project, we aimed to use the machine learning skills in this class and apply it to a popular field in machine learning: text classification. We found a great dataset that put together 50,000 movie reviews for binary classification based on whether the movie review was positive or negative. This is useful for websites that serve as aggregates for movie reviews, such as Rotten tomatoes, as users can submit their reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is self contained and shares all the results for understanding, but should one want to run the code for themselves, here is the github link where our data lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/Deionus/345-final\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 0: The Data and Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comes from an article titled *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis* written by Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. It is very robust which will make it incredibly useful as large data sets help the accuracy of our classifier. It includes the text files of the 50,000 reviews along with some other processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, Miguel Fernández Zafra wrote an article titled *Text Classification in Python* that was helpful in explaining what natural language processing entailed and how machine learning fits in. The implementation and procedure was made on our own, but it gave us some useful ideas to consider for natural language processing as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Link to article: https://towardsdatascience.com/text-classification-in-python-dd95d264c802\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Feature Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset divided the reviews into 25,000 positive reviews and 25,000 negative reviews split evenly into training and test sets. Furthermore, the creators of the dataset turned each review into a tokenized bag of words that matches with a vocab set. The vocab set list has every words that comes up in the review set and maps it to a number. However, there are still a few things we needed to do to get the data ready for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Text Clean-Up and Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "While the bag of words is a great start, the word count doesn't give the whole story. We want to better represent the words by representing not only the word count in the review but how relative it is in document frequency (A word that appears in every document is not as useful as a word that only appears in positive movies for example. We will achieve this by using a tf-idf (term frequency to inverse document frequency) score which we will then vectorize to use for classification. While scikit-learn has a tdf function, it doesn't work with the bag of words given in the data, hence why we wrote our own implementation."

    "\n",
    "We were excited to find that our classifier was successful in classifying the reviews that we pulled in. The accuracy is generally high, but there's even more that we can do to boost the accuracy. While we did a lot of preprocessing on our end for the text files, there's still a degree to overfitting that could be accounted for. For example, words that have the same base could be accounted for with lemmatization and stemming. Furthermore, while the tf-idf frequency helped account for common words like stop words, it could help the processing become quicker if we removed them at all. Finally, we could explore beyond reviews and use the same procedures for classifying a movie based on genre for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing is becoming more and more popular as an incredibly useful tool with vast applications. We are excited to continue using the machine learning principles we've learned in this class to go even further in the world of machine learning."
