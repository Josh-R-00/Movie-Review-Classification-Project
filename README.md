# Movie-Review-Classification-Project

## Description

In this project, my partner Deionus and I utilized the skills we learned in our intro to machine learning class
to develop a machine learning model that could classify movie reviews by whether they were positive or negative based on
the text content. 

For out dataset of choice, we used a dataset that comes from an article titled Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis written by 
Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts.
It includes the text files of the 50,000 reviews along with some other processed data to help with our machine learning model.

To learn more about our project, the file "project.ipnyb" is a jupyter notebook that walks through our entire process of building the 
model and testing it with other movie reviews we collected.
